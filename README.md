# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a combination software and hardware product.

I will program a baterial organism game that models the biology concept of Symobsis specifically mutualism.  The idea behind this game would be you are an organism that needs to bind to a secondary molecule to survive (because the molecule is unable to live on its own).  The bateria molecule would slowly die as it is trying to connect with the secondary molecule to ensure it's survival.

This game would be great for biology class due to the fact that this is a very real topic and a real case scenario, I hope this application can be used to help students to gain a greater understanding of mutalism.  
## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class (that we developed earlier together) to allow for force accumulation (wind, gravity, other forces)
* make the arrow keys translate to movement
* make it so movement is faster and slower in some areas
* modify colour so that every second you begin to slightly fade
* have the final destination (other bacteria) and once you connect with that destination, the simulation ends
