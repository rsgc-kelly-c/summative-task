# Summative Task

## Overall goal

My summative task will be a combination software and hardware product.

I will program a baterial organism game that models the biology concept of Symobsis specifically mutualism.  The idea behind this game would be you are an organism that needs to bind to a secondary molecule to survive (because the molecule is unable to live on its own).  The bateria molecule would slowly die as it is trying to connect with the secondary molecule to ensure it's survival.

This game would be great for biology class due to the fact that this is a very real topic and a real case scenario, I hope this application can be used to help students to gain a greater understanding of mutalism.  
## Sub-goals

* extend Motion class (that we developed earlier together) to allow for force accumulation (wind, gravity, other forces)
* make the mouse movement translate to a wind force
* make it so that moving the mouse causes the "seeds" of the dandelion to disperse
* modify the visual representation of the Motion class to more closely resembly dandelion seeds
* identify an Arduino sensor that might work to detect air pressure / volume
* program sensor to send values to Processing sketch
* translate sensor output to wind force in sketch
